## Homepage Carousel Pictures
### Editting the first 2 images
* **Notes:** This can be done on the Wordpress Admin page
* On the Wordpress Admin page:
    * Go to Appearance -> Customize
    * Go to Slider
    * From there, you can easily add/remove pictures, edit title, link on button,...
    * Make sure to click "Publish" after your edit
### Editting images after the first 2
* **Notes:** This should be done by someone who knows how to code. There's no way to find out if your code has bugs or not while editting on the Wordpress Admin page, so make sure to edit with caution. Once you submmit the code, if it has some bugs, the whole site will crash and become unaccessible through the Admin page.
* First, upload the picture you want for your new slide by following these steps
    * Using a FTP program (like FileZilla), connect to our web server with these info:
        * Host: 50.87.249.193
        * Username: developer@roylaboratory.com
        * Password: [Same password for every other account, ask Dr. Roy]
        * Port: 21
    * Go to public_html -> wp-content -> themes -> agama -> assets -> img
    * Within the img folder, drag in (upload) the image you want your slider to have
    * **Remember** the file name of this image for adding in the code later
* Once you upload your image, in the Wordpress Admin page:
    * Go to Appearance -> Editor
    * Find and click on ```class-agama-slider.php``` in the **Theme Files** column to the right. It should be under *framework*.
    * Click **Proceed** button
    * There are two text-editor boxes, you can use the one below for better code visual.
* Once you have access to edit the file, follow these steps to Add/Remove/Edit slides:
    * 1st: add/edit/remove the code to **initialize the variables** for the slides. The code looks like this
    ```php
    # Slide 3
    $slide['3']['img']          = esc_url( get_theme_mod( 'agama_slider_image_3', AGAMA_IMG . 'IMG_6447.jpg' ) );
	$slide['3']['title']        = esc_attr( get_theme_mod( 'agama_slider_title_3', 'Explore Our Campus' ) );
	$slide['3']['animate']      = esc_attr( get_theme_mod( 'agama_slider_title_animation_3', 'bounceInLeft' ) );
	$slide['3']['title_color']  = esc_attr( get_theme_mod( 'agama_slider_title_color_3', '#fff' ) );
	$button['3']['title']       = esc_attr( get_theme_mod( 'agama_slider_button_title_3', 'Learn More' ) );
	$button['3']['animate']     = esc_attr( get_theme_mod( 'agama_slider_button_animation_3', 'bounceInRight' ) );
	$button['3']['url']         = esc_url( get_theme_mod( 'agama_slider_button_url_3', '#' ) );
    ```
    * You should only the change the values of ```$slide['3']['img']```, ```$slide['3']['title']```, ```$button['3']['title'] ``` and ```$button['3']['url']```. **Use the filename of the image you just uploaded** and replace it in ```$slide['3']['img']```, after ```AGAMA_IMG . ```
    * 2nd: add/edit/remove the code to **render the new slide**. Make sure you have all the variables name correct.
    ```php
    // Extra code to render slider 3
    if( $slide['3']['img'] ) {
        echo '<div data-src="'. $slide['3']['img'] .'">';
            echo '<div class="slide-content slide-3">';
                echo '<div class="slide-content-cell">';
                    echo '<div class="container">';
                        echo '<div class="row">';
                            echo '<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">';
                                if( $slide['3']['title'] ) {
                                    echo '<h2 class="slide-title animated '. $slide['3']['animate'] .'" style="color:'. $slide['3']['title_color'] .';">';
                                        echo $slide['3']['title'];
                                    echo '</h2>';
                                }
                                if( $button['3']['title'] ) {
                                    echo '<a href="'. $button['3']['url'] .'" class="button button-3d button-rounded button-xlarge animated '. $button['3']['animate'] .'">';
                                        echo $button['3']['title'];
                                    echo '</a>';
                                }
                            echo '</div>';
                        echo '</div>';
                    echo '</div>';
                echo '</div>';
            echo '</div>';
        echo '</div>';
    }
    // End extra code for slider 3
    ```

* Add URL to the title
* Add picture if needed
    * The picture needs to be **aligned center** (edit by clicking directly on the added picture)
    * The picture also needs to have a **1px black border**. 
        * To do this, switch to **Text** view. It's located on the top right corner of the editor.
        * Add ```style="border: solid black 1px;"``` to the ```<img>``` tag. The result should look like this:
```html
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-287" style="border: solid black 1px;" src="http://50.87.249.193/~roylabor/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/9.png" alt="" width="320" height="293" />
```

## Misc
### Page Align
* We use ```Column Shortcodes``` plugin to **align items within the page**
* To see out how to use it, go to Plugins -> Installed Plugins -> Column Shortcodes
* The use is pretty straight forward, just click ```[]``` button above of the editor in any page.
### Animate It!
* We use ```Animate It!``` plugin to **animate items within the page**
* Refer to its [documentation](https://www.downloads.eleopard.in/animate-it-documentation-wordpress/) for how to use it.
* There are already some animations within the page. It's best to keep the animations uniform and just use the same one across the site.
    * ```fadeIn``` - used in Publications
    * ```fadeIn``` - used in Members
